    "paragraph_2": "The Open Infrastructure Summit is organized around Tracks, which are focused on specific problem domains in Open Infrastructure, such as '5G, NFV & Edge', 'CI/CD', or 'Private & Hybrid Cloud'. Presentations for each Track are determined by a Programming Committee for each track, which is made up of 3-5 members. The Foundation selects the Programming Committee members from a list of people nominated by the community. The Foundation strives to recruit Programming Committee members from a diverse set of companies, regions and roles across communities (i.e., contributing developers, users and business leaders). To nominate someone for the Summit Programming Committee for a specific Track, please fill out the ",

    "paragraph_4": "Once the Call for Presentations has concluded, all submissions will be made available for community vote and input. After community voting closes, Programming Committee members will receive their presentations to review and will determine the final selections for their respective Tracks. Community votes are meant to help inform the decision, but are not the only guide. Programming Committee members are expected to exercise judgment in their area of expertise and help ensure diversity of sessions and speakers. Real-world user stories and technical, in-the-trenches experiences are favored over sales pitches.",
