    "paragraph_2": "The OpenInfra Summit is organized around Tracks, which are focused on specific problem domains in Open Infrastructure, such as Telco, NFV & Edge', 'CI/CD', or ‘Private Cloud and Virtualization Migration'. Presentations for each Track are determined by Track Chairs for each track, which is made up of 3-5 members. The Foundation selects the Track Chairs members from a list of people nominated by the community. The Foundation strives to recruit Track Chairs members from a diverse set of companies, regions and roles across communities (i.e., contributing developers, users and business leaders).",
    "paragraph_3": "The Foundation will also extend invitations directly to a small number of highly regarded speakers from past events for each Track, and we expect this content to make up less than 15% of total Summit presentations.",
    "paragraph_4": "Track Chairs members will receive their presentations to review and will determine the final selections for their respective Tracks. Track Chair members are expected to exercise judgment in their area of expertise and help ensure diversity of sessions and speakers. Real-world user stories and technical, in-the-trenches experiences are favored over sales pitches.",
    "paragraph_5": "After the Track Chairs make their decisions, speakers will be informed by July 2025. If you are selected as a speaker (or alternate speaker), you will receive a free code to register for the Summit, as well as a set of deadlines and deliverables leading up to the event.",
